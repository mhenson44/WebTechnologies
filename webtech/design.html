<h1>Good and Bad Web Design</h1>
	<p>
	In this assignment we will be looking at more examples of good and bad web design.  To see more examples of good web design, please vist
	<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-essentials-examples-and-best-practices/">Smashing Magazines examples of good design</a>
	.  You should read the pages there on best practices.  Look at the examples there and pick 5 examples from the site or anywhere else of Web sites where you like the design.
	I want you to present the pages you like and a description of a minimum of three reasons why you like them in the following format: 
	
	</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>
<h2>Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computers</a>
<p>
I like this site, because it is simple and balanced.  I like the fact that the designer was not afraid to use a lot of white space on the main page.  I uses a basic color palate consistently throughout the entire site.  
I like the fact that the home page has only a few links to very logical categories.  Even though there are only a few links on this 
homepage, you are only a few clicks from most things you would want to find on the site.

</p>

<h2>First Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US">Xbox</a> 
<p>The color scheme isn't heavy on the eyes. Has good tabs for all services.I like the xbox website because it makes it easy for people to either search for exactly what they need as far as games and or support for their microsoft xbox account.
</p>
<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> 
<p>I like the twitch website because it makes it easy for views to find the types of catagories that they want to watch as well as find other streamers that they may be interested in watching. The site has a good color scheme as well. Website also makes it easy to use and create an account.</p>
<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> 
<p> Amazon is the best designed website by far making it very easy for anybody to find any type of product that they need to buy. The homepage has enough information to be able to find the correct section. The website is very simple and easy to use.  </p>
<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> 
<p>Youtube is another website that is designed well to it's user to be able to search for any type of video that they are looking for as well as giving some catagories of different video sections. There are also videos that pop up on the home page that may peak your interest. The red also gives youtube a branding for YT. </p>
<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://stockx.com/">Stockx</a> 
<p>Stockx is a great website for anybody trying to find a type of shoe or apparal, as well as for reselling shoes. This website splits up into different catagories based on what your looking for as well. The color scheme is simple, there are also pictures of the items on the home page.</p>
<h1>The Bad and the Ugly</h1>
<p>For this part of the assignment, I want you to do the same thing you did for the first part, but instead
of what you like, you will be describing what you don't like.  You must include at least three reasons that the site 
you don't like has bad design.  You can find many examples of bad design on this 
<a href="https://blog.rankingbyseo.com/bad-websites/">list of the top 50 worst Web sites</a>
.</p>
<h2>First Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale</a> 
<p>This website doesn't have goot spacing for anything. There isn't a specific color scheme, just different colors mashed together. The text is also hard to read because it blends with the background color. </p>
<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://simcast.com/">Simcast</a> 
<p>The headings aren't alined at the top. The cookies pop up is very annoying right in the middle of the screen. The catagories are hard to find on the screen. </p>
<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.4chan.org/">4Chan</a> 
<p>There are no images, a boring logo, and there is no way to determine which information is more important.</p>
<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://mumbai.craigslist.org/">Craiglist</a> 
<p>It's just a lot of words jumbled up in one place. There isn't enough spacing at all. It's hard to tell what your looking at.</p>
<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.exmouth-view.co.uk/">Exmouth Hotel</a> 
<p>As soon as you open the website, all you see is a picture, no words. Doesn't look very professtional at all. You can't really tell that it's a site for a hotel. </p>
